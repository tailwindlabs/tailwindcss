<!-- Please provide all of the information requested below. We're a small team and without all of this information it's not possible for us to help and your bug report will be closed. -->

**What version of Tailwind CSS are you using?**

For example: v4.0.6

**What build tool (or framework if it abstracts the build tool) are you using?**

For example: postcss-cli 11.0.0, Next.js 15.1.7, Vite 6.1.0

**What version of Node.js are you using?**

For example: v20.0.0

**What browser are you using?**

For example: Chrome, Safari, or N/A

**What operating system are you using?**

For example: macOS, Windows

**Reproduction URL**

A Tailwind Play link or public GitHub repo that includes a minimal reproduction of the bug. **Please do not link to your actual project**, what we need instead is a _minimal_ reproduction in a fresh project without any unnecessary code. This means it doesn't matter if your real project is private/confidential, since we want a link to a separate, isolated reproduction anyways.

A reproduction is **required** when filing an issue — any issue opened without a reproduction will be closed and you'll be asked to create a new issue that includes a reproduction. We're a small team and we can't keep up with the volume of issues we receive if we need to reproduce each issue from scratch ourselves.

**Describe your issue**

Describe the problem you're seeing, any important steps to reproduce and what behavior you expect instead.
