## JIT engine in core

The [brand-new JIT engine we announced in March](https://blog.tailwindcss.com/just-in-time-the-next-generation-of-tailwind-css) has now been merged into core, and is available as an opt-in feature using a new `mode` option in your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: [
    // ...
  ],
  // ...
}
```

**This feature is still in preview** which means some details may change as we iron out the kinks, and it's not subject to semantic versioning.

If you were using `@tailwindcss/jit` before, you can now migrate to Tailwind CSS v2.1 instead, as that's where all new development on the engine will happen.

Read the [Just-in-Time Mode documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/just-in-time-mode) to learn more.

## Composable CSS filters API

This is a huge one — we've finally added first-class support for CSS filters!

They work a lot like our `transform` utilities, where you use `filter` to enable filters, and combine it with utilities like `grayscale`, `blur-lg`, or `saturate-200` to compose filters on the fly.

Here's what `filter` looks like:

```html
<div class="filter blur-md grayscale invert ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

...and here's what `backdrop-filter` looks like:

```html
<div class="backdrop-filter backdrop-blur backdrop-brightness-50 ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

Check out the [filter](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/filter) and [backdrop-filter](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/backdrop-filter) to learn more. We'll add a bunch of helpful visual examples there soon!

## New blending mode utilities

We've added brand new utilities for `mix-blend-mode` and `background-blend-mode`:

```html
<div class="mix-blend-multiply ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

Check out [the documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/mix-blend-mode) to learn more.

## New isolation utilities

We've added new `isolate` and `isolation-auto` utilities for working with the `isolation` property:

```html
<div class="isolate ...">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

This can be really helpful for scoping blending mode features or z-index adjustments and is super powerful. Check out [the documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/isolation) to learn more.

I also highly recommend [this great article by Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/stacking-contexts/#airtight-abstractions-with-isolation) to see it in action.

## Upgrading

Tailwind CSS v2.1 is an incremental upgrade with no breaking changes, so to upgrade you just need to run:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@latest
```

If you were previously using `@tailwindcss/jit`, you can now switch back to `tailwindcss` and update your PostCSS configuration accordingly.
