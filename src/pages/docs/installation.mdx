## <Heading number="1">Install Tailwind via npm</Heading>

For most projects (and to take advantage of Tailwind's customization features), you'll want to install Tailwind via npm.

```bash
# Using npm
npm install tailwindcss

# Using Yarn
yarn add tailwindcss
```

## <Heading number="2">Add Tailwind to your CSS</Heading>

Use the `@tailwind` directive to inject Tailwind's `base`, `components`, and `utilities` styles into your CSS:

```css
@tailwind base;

@tailwind components;

@tailwind utilities;
```

Tailwind will swap these directives out at build time with all of its generated CSS.

If you're using `postcss-import` (or a tool that uses it under the hood, such as [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) for Rails), use our imports instead of the `@tailwind` directive to avoid issues when importing any of your own additional files:

```css
@import "tailwindcss/base";

@import "tailwindcss/components";

@import "tailwindcss/utilities";
```

## <Heading number="3">Create your Tailwind config file <span className="text-gray-600" children="(optional)" /></Heading>

If you'd like to customize your Tailwind installation, you can generate a config file for your project using the Tailwind CLI utility included when you install the `tailwindcss` npm package:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

This will create a minimal `tailwind.config.js` file at the root of your project:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {},
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Learn more about configuring Tailwind in the [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration).

## <Heading number="4">Process your CSS with Tailwind</Heading>

### Using Tailwind with PostCSS

For most projects, you'll want to add Tailwind as a PostCSS plugin in your build chain.

Generally this means adding Tailwind as a plugin in your `postcss.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require('tailwindcss'),
    require('autoprefixer'),
    // ...
  ]
}
```

We've included more specific instructions for a few popular tools below, but for instructions on getting started with PostCSS in general, see the [PostCSS documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage).

### Using Tailwind CLI

For simple projects or just giving Tailwind a spin, you can use the Tailwind CLI tool to process your CSS:

```bash
npx tailwindcss build styles.css -o output.css
```

Use the `npx tailwindcss help build` command to learn more about the various CLI options.

### Build Tool Examples

We've included some basic examples of setting up Tailwind with common build tools below, but also look at our [setup-examples](https://github.com/tailwindcss/setup-examples/) repository for even more examples that you can even clone and play with locally.

#### Webpack

Add `tailwindcss` as a plugin in your  `postcss.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    // ...
    require('tailwindcss'),
    require('autoprefixer'),
    // ...
  ]
}
```

...or include it directly in your [postcss-loader](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-loader) configuration in your `webpack.config.js` file:

```js
// webpack.config.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        // ...
        use: [
          // ...
          {
            loader: 'postcss-loader',
            options: {
              ident: 'postcss',
              plugins: [
                require('tailwindcss'),
                require('autoprefixer'),
              ],
            },
          },
        ],
      }
    ],
  }
}
```

#### Gulp

Add `tailwindcss` to the list of plugins you pass to [gulp-postcss](https://github.com/postcss/gulp-postcss):

```js
gulp.task('css', function () {
  const postcss = require('gulp-postcss')

  return gulp.src('src/styles.css')
    // ...
    .pipe(postcss([
      // ...
      require('tailwindcss'),
      require('autoprefixer'),
      // ...
    ]))
    // ...
    .pipe(gulp.dest('build/'))
})
```

#### Laravel Mix

If you're writing your project in plain CSS, use Mix's `postCss` method to process your CSS and include `tailwindcss` as a plugin:

```js
mix.postCss('resources/css/main.css', 'public/css', [
  require('tailwindcss'),
])
```

If you're using a preprocessor, use the `options` method to add `tailwindcss` as a PostCSS plugin:

```js
const tailwindcss = require('tailwindcss')

mix.less('resources/less/app.less', 'public/css')
  .options({
    postCss: [
      tailwindcss('./path/to/your/tailwind.config.js'),
    ]
  })
```

**Note for Sass users:** Due to [an unresolved issue](https://github.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader/issues/28) with one of Mix's dependencies, to use Sass with Tailwind you'll need to disable `processCssUrls`:

```js
const tailwindcss = require('tailwindcss')

mix.sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css')
  .options({
    processCssUrls: false,
    postCss: [ tailwindcss('./path/to/your/tailwind.config.js') ],
  })
```

For more information on what this feature does and the implications of disabling it, [see the Laravel Mix documentation](https://laravel-mix.com/docs/5.0/css-preprocessors#css-url-rewriting).

#### Webpack Encore

Create a `postcss.config.js` file, add `tailwindcss` as a plugin and pass the path to your config file:

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    require('tailwindcss'),
  ]
}
```

Within `webpack.config.js`, create a style entry and enable the PostCSS loader.

```js
const Encore = require('@symfony/webpack-encore')

Encore
  .setOutputPath('public/build/')
  .setPublicPath('/build')
  .addStyleEntry('app', './css/app.css')
  .enablePostCssLoader()

module.exports = Encore.getWebpackConfig()
```

You can also pass options into the PostCSS loader by passing a callback, as per the [Encore PostCSS docs](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/encore/postcss.html):

```js
Encore.enablePostCssLoader(function(options) {
  options.config = {
    path: 'config/postcss.config.js'
  }
})
```

**Note for Sass users:** Due to [an unresolved issue](https://github.com/bholloway/resolve-url-loader/issues/28) with one of Encore's dependencies, to use Sass with Tailwind you'll need to disable `resolveUrlLoader`:

```js
Encore.enableSassLoader(function (options) {}, {
  resolveUrlLoader: false
})
```


#### Brunch

Add `tailwindcss` to the list of processors you pass to [postcss-brunch](https://github.com/brunch/postcss-brunch):

```js
exports.config = {
  // ..
  plugins: {
    // ...
    postcss: {
      processors: [
        require('tailwindcss'),
      ]
    }
    // ...
  }
}
```

#### Ember.js

Add `tailwindcss` to the list of plugins you pass to [ember-cli-postcss](https://github.com/jeffjewiss/ember-cli-postcss):

```js
// ember-cli-build.js
'use strict';

const EmberApp = require('ember-cli/lib/broccoli/ember-app');

module.exports = function(defaults) {
  let app = new EmberApp(defaults, {
    postcssOptions: {
      compile: {
        plugins: [
          require('tailwindcss')
        ]
      }
    }
  });
  return app.toTree();
};
```

## Using Tailwind via CDN

Before using the CDN build, please note that many of the features that make Tailwind CSS great are not available without incorporating Tailwind into your build process.

<List>
  <ListItemBad>You can't customize Tailwind's default theme</ListItemBad>
  <ListItemBad>You can't use any <a href="/docs/functions-and-directives">directives</a> like <code>@apply</code>, <code>@variants</code>, etc.</ListItemBad>
  <ListItemBad>You can't enable features like <a href="/docs/pseudo-class-variants#group-hover"><code>group-hover</code></a></ListItemBad>
  <ListItemBad>You can't install third-party plugins</ListItemBad>
  <ListItemBad>You can't tree-shake unused styles</ListItemBad>
</List>

To get the most out of Tailwind, you really should [install it via npm](#install-tailwind-via-npm).

To pull in Tailwind for quick demos or just giving the framework a spin, grab the latest default configuration build via CDN:

```html
<link href="https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^1.0/dist/tailwind.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

Note that while the CDN build is large *(27kb compressed, 348kb raw)*, **it's not representative of the sizes you see when including Tailwind as part of your build process**.

Sites that follow our [best practices](/docs/controlling-file-size) are almost always under 10kb compressed. For example, [Firefox Send](https://send.firefox.com/) is built with Tailwind and their CSS is under 4kb compressed and minified.
