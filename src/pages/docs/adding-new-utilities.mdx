description: Extending Tailwind with your own custom utility classes.

import { TipGood, TipBad } from '@/components/Tip'

Although Tailwind provides a pretty comprehensive set of utility classes out of the box, you may run into situations where you need to add a few of your own.

Deciding on the best way to extend a framework can be paralyzing, so here are some best practices to help you add your own utilities in the most idiomatic way possible.

---

## Using CSS

The easiest way to add your own utilities to Tailwind is to simply add them to your CSS.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer utilities {
  .scroll-snap-none {
    scroll-snap-type: none;
  }
  .scroll-snap-x {
    scroll-snap-type: x;
  }
  .scroll-snap-y {
    scroll-snap-type: y;
  }
}
```

By using the `@layer` directive, Tailwind will automatically move those styles to the same place as `@tailwind utilities` to avoid unintended specificity issues.

Using the `@layer` directive will also instruct Tailwind to consider those styles for purging when purging the `utilities` layer. Read our [Controlling File Size](/docs/controlling-file-size) documentation for more details.

### Generating responsive variants

If you'd like to create [responsive variants](/docs/responsive-design) of your own utilities based on the breakpoints defined in your `tailwind.config.js` file, wrap your utilities in the `@responsive` directive:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer utilities {
  @responsive {
    .scroll-snap-none {
      scroll-snap-type: none;
    }
    .scroll-snap-x {
      scroll-snap-type: x;
    }
    .scroll-snap-y {
      scroll-snap-type: y;
    }
  }
}
```

Tailwind will automatically generate prefixed versions of each custom utility that you can use to conditionally apply those styles at different breakpoints:

```html
<!-- Use `scroll-snap-type: none` by default, then use `scroll-snap-type: x` on medium screens and up -->
<div class="scroll-snap-none md:scroll-snap-x"></div>
```

Learn more about responsive utilities in the [responsive design documentation](/docs/responsive-design).

### Generating pseudo-class variants

If you'd like to create [pseudo-class variants](/docs/pseudo-class-variants) of your own utilities, wrap your utilities in the `@variants` directive:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer utilities {
  @variants hover, focus {
    .filter-none {
      filter: none;
    }
    .filter-grayscale {
      filter: grayscale(100%);
    }
  }
}
```

Tailwind will automatically generate prefixed versions of each custom utility that you can use to conditionally apply those styles at different states:

```html
<div class="filter-grayscale hover:filter-none"></div>
```

Pseudo-class variants are generated in the same order you list them in the `@variants` directive, so if you'd like one pseudo-class to take precedence over another, make sure you list that one last:

```css
/* Focus will take precedence over hover */
@variants hover, focus {
  .filter-grayscale {
    filter: grayscale(100%);
  }
  /* ... */
}

/* Hover will take precedence over focus */
@variants focus, hover {
  .filter-grayscale {
    filter: grayscale(100%);
  }
  /* ... */
}
```

If you'd like to generate both responsive _and_ pseudo-class variants of your custom utilities, wrap `@variants` with `@responsive`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer utilities {
  @responsive {
    @variants hover, focus {
      .filter-none {
        filter: none;
      }
      .filter-grayscale {
        filter: grayscale(100%);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Learn more about pseudo-class variants utilities in the [pseudo-class variant documentation](/docs/pseudo-class-variants).

## Using a plugin

In addition to adding new utility classes directly in your CSS files, you can also add utilities to Tailwind by writing your own plugin:

```js
// tailwind.config.js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function({ addUtilities }) {
      const newUtilities = {
        '.filter-none': {
          filter: 'none',
        },
        '.filter-grayscale': {
          filter: 'grayscale(100%)',
        },
      }

      addUtilities(newUtilities, ['responsive', 'hover'])
    })
  ]
}

```

This can be a good choice if you want to publish your custom utilities as a library or make it easier to share them across multiple projects.
