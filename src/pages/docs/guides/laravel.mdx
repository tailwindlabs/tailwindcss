## Creating your project

Start by creating a new Laravel project if you don't have one set up already. The most common approach is to use the [Laravel Installer](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x#via-laravel-installer):

```shell
laravel new my-project
cd my-project
```

Next, install Laravel's front-end dependencies using `npm`:

```shell
npm install
```

## Setting up Tailwind CSS

Install Tailwind using `npm`:

```shell
npm install tailwindcss@compat
```

_Laravel Mix currently only supports PostCSS 7, so we need to install the PostCSS 7-compatible version of Tailwind CSS._

Next, generate your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```shell
npx tailwindcss init
```

In your `tailwind.config.js` file, configure the `purge` option with the paths to all of your templates and JavaScript files so Tailwind can tree-shake unused styles when [optimizing for production](/docs/optimizing-for-production):

```diff-js
  // tailwind.config.js
  module.exports = {
-   purge: [],
+   purge: [
+     './resources/**/*.blade.php',
+     './resources/**/*.js',
+     './resources/**/*.vue',
    ],
    darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  }
```

Open the `resources/css/app.css` file provided by Laravel and add a `@tailwind` directive for each of Tailwind's layers:

```css
/* ./resources/css/app.css */
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Make sure your CSS file is being processed in your `webpack.mix.js` file, and add `tailwindcss` to the list of PostCSS plugins:

```diff-js
  // webpack.mix.js
  mix.js("resources/js/app.js", "public/js")
      .postCss("resources/css/tailwind.css", "public/css", [
+       require("tailwindcss"),
      ]);
```

Next, import your stylesheet in your main Blade layout (commonly `resources/views/layouts/app.php`) and add the responsive viewport meta tag if it's not already present:

```diff-html
  <!doctype html>
  <head>
    <!-- ... --->
+   <meta charset="UTF-8" />
+   <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
+   <link href="{{ asset('css/app.css') }}" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <!-- ... --->
```

Finally, compile your CSS using Laravel Mix:

```shell
# Compile your development assets
npm run dev

# Compile your production assets
npm run dev
```

That's it! Tailwind CSS is now ready to use in your project.
