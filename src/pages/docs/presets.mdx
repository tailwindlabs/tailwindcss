import { TipGood, TipBad } from '@/components/Tip'
import { ThemeReference } from '@/components/ThemeReference'

By default, any configuration you add in your own `tailwind.config.js` file is intelligently merged with the [default configuration](https://unpkg.com/browse/tailwindcss@^2/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js), with your own configuration acting as a set of overrides and extensions.

The `presets` option lets you specify a _different_ configuration to use as your base, making it easy to package up a set of customizations that you'd like to reuse across projects.

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('@acmecorp/tailwind-base')
  ],
  // ...
}
```

This can be very useful for teams that manage multiple Tailwind projects for the same brand where they want a single source of truth for colors, fonts, and other common customizations.

## Creating a preset

Presets are just regular Tailwind configuration objects, taking the exact same shape as the configuration you would add in your `tailwind.config.js` file.

```js my-preset.js
// Example preset
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    colors: {
      blue: {
        light: '#85d7ff',
        DEFAULT: '#1fb6ff',
        dark: '#009eeb',
      },
      pink: {
        light: '#ff7ce5',
        DEFAULT: '#ff49db',
        dark: '#ff16d1',
      },
      gray: {
        darkest: '#1f2d3d',
        dark: '#3c4858',
        DEFAULT: '#c0ccda',
        light: '#e0e6ed',
        lightest: '#f9fafc',
      }
    },
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ['Graphik', 'sans-serif'],
    },
    extend: {
      flexGrow: {
        2: '2',
        3: '3',
      },
      zIndex: {
        60: '60',
        70: '70',
        80: '80',
        90: '90',
        100: '100',
      },
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    require('@tailwindcss/typography'),
    require('@tailwindcss/aspect-ratio'),
  ],
}
```

As you can see, presets can contain all of the configuration options you're used to, including theme overrides and extensions, adding plugins, configuring a prefix, and so on. Read about [how configurations are merged](#merging-logic-in-depth) for more details.

Assuming this preset was saved at `./my-preset.js`, you would use it by adding it to the `tailwind.config.js` file in your actual project under the `presets` key:

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('./my-preset.js')
  ],
  // Customizations specific to this project would go here
  theme: {
    extend: {
      minHeight: {
        48: '12rem',
      }
    }
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      backgroundColor: ['active']
    },
  },
}
```

By default, presets themselves extend Tailwind's [default configuration](https://unpkg.com/browse/tailwindcss@^3/stubs/defaultConfig.stub.js) just like your own configuration would. If you'd like to create a preset that completely replaces the default configuration, include an empty `presets` key in the preset itself:

```js
// Example preset
module.exports = {
  presets: [],
  theme: {
    // ...
  },
  plugins: [
    // ...
  ],
}
```

## Merging logic in-depth

Project-specific configurations (those found in your `tailwind.config.js` file) are merged against presets the same way they are merged against the default configuration.

The following options in `tailwind.config.js` simply **replace** the same option if present in a preset:

- `content`
- `darkMode`
- `prefix`
- `important`
- `variantOrder`
- `separator`

The remaining options are each carefully merged in the way that makes the most sense for that option, explained in more detail below.

### Theme

The `theme` object is merged shallowly, with top-level keys in `tailwind.config.js` replacing the same top-level keys in any presets. The exception to this is the `extend` key, which is collected across all configurations and applied on top of the rest of the theme configuration.

Learn more about how the `theme` option works in the [theme configuration documentation](/docs/theme).

### Presets

The `presets` array is merged across configurations, allowing presets to include their own presets, which can also include their own presets.

### Plugins

The `plugins` array is merged across configurations to make it possible for a preset to register plugins while also allowing you to add additional plugins at the project-level.

This means it's not possible to disable a plugin that has been added by a preset. If you find yourself wanting to disable a plugin in a preset, it's a sign that you should probably remove that plugin from the preset and include it on a project-by-project basis instead, or [split your preset into two presets](#extending-multiple-presets).

### Core plugins

The `corePlugins` option behaves differently depending on whether you configure it as an object or as an array.

If you configure `corePlugins` as an object, it is merged across configurations.

```js my-preset.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  corePlugins: {
    float: false,
  },
}
```

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('./my-preset.js'),
  ],
  // This configuration will be merged
  corePlugins: {
    cursor: false
  }
}
```

If you configure `corePlugins` as an array, it replaces any `corePlugins` configuration provided by your configured preset(s).

```js my-preset.js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  corePlugins: {
    float: false,
  },
}
```

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('./example-preset.js'),
  ],
  // This will replace the configuration in the preset
  corePlugins: ['float', 'padding', 'margin']
}
```

---

## Extending multiple presets

The `presets` option is an array and can accept multiple presets. This is useful if you want to split your reusable customizations up into composable chunks that can be imported independently.

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('@acmecorp/tailwind-colors'),
    require('@acmecorp/tailwind-fonts'),
    require('@acmecorp/tailwind-spacing'),
  ]
}
```

When adding multiple presets, it's important to note that if they overlap in any way, they are resolved the same way your own customizations are resolved against a preset, and the last configuration wins.

For example, if both of these configurations provided a custom color palette (and were not using `extend`), the color palette from `configuration-b` would be used:

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('@acmecorp/configuration-a'),
    require('@acmecorp/configuration-b'),
  ]
}
```

---

## Disabling the default configuration

If you'd like to completely disable the default configuration and start with no base configuration at all, set `presets` to an empty array:

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [],
  // ...
}
```

This will completely disable all of Tailwind's defaults, so no colors, font families, font sizes, spacing values, etc. will be generated at all.

You can also do this from within a preset if you'd like your preset to provide a complete design system on its own that doesn't extend Tailwind's defaults:

```js my-preset.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [],
  // ...
}
```

```js tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    require('./example-preset.js')
  ],
  // ...
}
```
