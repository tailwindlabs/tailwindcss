title: Adding Base Styles
description: Best practices for adding your own global base styles on top of Tailwind.
---

Base (or global) styles are the styles at the beginning of a stylesheet that set useful defaults for basic HTML elements like `<a>` tags, headings, etc. or apply opinionated resets like the popular [box-sizing reset](https://www.paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/).

Tailwind includes a useful set of base styles out of the box that we call [Preflight](/docs/preflight), which is really just [modern-normalize](https://github.com/sindresorhus/modern-normalize) plus a thin layer of additional more opinionated styles.

Preflight is a great starting point for most projects, but if you'd ever like to add your own additional base styles, here are some recommendations for doing it idiomatically.

## Using classes in your HTML

If you just want to apply some global styling to the `html` or `body` elements, consider just adding existing classes to those elements in your HTML instead of writing new CSS:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en" class="text-gray-900 leading-tight">
  <!-- ... -->
  <body class="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">
    <!-- ... -->
  </body>
</html>
```

## Using CSS

If you want to apply some base styles to specific elements, the easiest way is to simply add them in your CSS.

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  h1 {
    @apply text-2xl;
  }
  h2 {
    @apply text-xl;
  }
}
```

By using the `@layer` directive, Tailwind will automatically move those styles to the same place as `@tailwind base` to avoid unintended specificity issues.

Using the `@layer` directive will also instruct Tailwind to consider those styles for purging when purging the `base` layer. Read our [documentation on optimizing for production](/docs/optimizing-for-production) for more details.

It's a good idea to use [@apply](/docs/functions-and-directives#apply) or [theme()](/docs/functions-and-directives#theme) to define these styles to avoid accidentally deviating from your design system.

### @font-face rules

You can use the same approach to add your `@font-face` rules for any custom fonts you're using:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer base {
  @font-face {
    font-family: Proxima Nova;
    font-weight: 400;
    src: url(/fonts/proxima-nova/400-regular.woff) format("woff");
  }
  @font-face {
    font-family: Proxima Nova;
    font-weight: 500;
    src: url(/fonts/proxima-nova/500-medium.woff) format("woff");
  }
}
```

## Using a plugin

You can also add base styles by [writing a plugin](/docs/plugins#adding-base-styles) and using the `addBase` function:

```js tailwind.config.js
const plugin = require('tailwindcss/plugin')

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(function({ addBase, theme }) {
      addBase({
        'h1': { fontSize: theme('fontSize.2xl') },
        'h2': { fontSize: theme('fontSize.xl') },
        'h3': { fontSize: theme('fontSize.lg') },
      })
    })
  ]
}
```

Any styles added using `addBase` will be inserted into the `base` layer alongside Tailwind's other base styles.
