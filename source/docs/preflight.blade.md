description: "An opinionated set of base styles for Tailwind projects."

Coming soon.

In a nutshell:

- An opinionated layer on top of [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css/)
- Intended to make it hard to accidentally deviate from your design system, so elements like headings are intentionally unstyled
- [See the source code](https://github.com/tailwindcss/tailwindcss/blob/next/src/plugins/css/preflight.css) to see what styles are applied
